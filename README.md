# Prompt Fighters Arena

One file. No excuses.

This is the HTML file that refused to stay simple.

Inside a single 2 MB page lives a full competitive fighter:  
- AI-generated fighters from your prompt  
- AI-merged battle arenas built from both players  
- Emoji projectiles that actually read your text  
- Headshot uploads with live cropping  
- Combos → super bursts  
- Airstrikes, UFO raids, shields, invis, chaos items  
- Agent K silently judging from the sky  

It runs edge-to-edge on desktop.  
It runs 60 fps on a $79 phone.  
It knows you’re on mobile and quietly cranks damage ×2.9, cuts HP to 260, slashes particles by 85 %, and speeds everything up so the fight still feels like Street Fighter, not a PowerPoint.

No frameworks.  
No build step.  
No mercy.

Just open the file and throw down.

You’ll lose in 60 seconds.  
You’ll immediately hit “next round.”  
That’s the point.
